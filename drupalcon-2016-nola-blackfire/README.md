* Dave was there to show us version control and Linux
* Besides doing Drupal projects since 2008...

--end--

## Why profiling is important

* UX, $, concurrency + scalability
* What we aren't measuring
 * loading, front-end, browser rendering
* What we are measuring
  * profiling is like xray glasses {IMG} for your code
 * what profiling shows
 * page generation time, CPU + memory info
 * blocking operations: SQL + external requests
* Example scenario of Drupal slowness

--end--

## Profiling results

* Blackfire.io is a great PHP profiling tool
* Profiling gets DRAMATIC results, pretty fast:
  1. McGill Course Calendar
    * didn't use node_load_multiple
    * 260ms -> 225ms, 13%
    * took 1h to locate and fix a problem
  1. Client X
    * slow redirect (390ms -> 95ms), took an hour to diagnose and fix
    * references\_dialog old buggy version
      * 1s to 770ms (23%)
      * took 30m to diagnose, instant fix
    * uncached menu
      * 770ms to 480ms
      * took 2 hours to diagnose, several hours to fix
    * Took a day to diagnose and fix these PARTIAL problems, on an unfamiliar codebase
  1. D8 evolvingweb.ca site
    * block visibility (80ms out of 450ms, 18%)
    * metatag module patch (saves 30ms)
    * took 2 hours to identify problems, + 2 days to fix
  1. Linux Foundation / AllSeen Alliance CAWT
    * Views handling of revisions inefficient; runs entity_load on each one
    * used xdebug + reading code to figure out why
    * Took 3 hours to diagnose + add revision cache
    * 980ms -> 420ms

--end--

## What is "fast"?

* Identify performance goals: what does it mean to be fast?
  * VS other sites
  * VS user expectations
  * Isolate front-end from back-end
  * Understand cached vs uncached behavior
  * why varnish isn't enough

--end--

## How to profile

* Define behavior externally (path, logged in, environment, isolation, caching...)
* Study call graph to get a diagnosis
* Log your runs, later it will be hard to remember all you've changed
* Look for any low hanging fruit, bottleneck
  * (easily cachable requests, bad SQL, blocking requests, unecessary entity loads, watchdog,...)
* Look for signs of overall sluggishness (eg swapping, hard-drive contention, network issues, slow/shared server, lack of APC)
* Build a hypothesis on the bottleneck
* Log the scenario, mark it as a reference (baseline)
* Make a change, do a comparison
  * In drupal, static caching means removing "slow" code just pushes it to later in request
* Iteration
* Know when to stop profiling
  * compare variations: pages, site, server env, enable/disable modules, comment out code

--end--

## Tools

* Tools {INLINE THIS?}
 * Chrome dev tools (YSlow, GTMetrix, WebPageTest.org, Google PageSpeed Insights)
 * ab (Apache bench)
 * devel sql query log
 * APM: newrelic/zen
 * xhprof / blackfire
* Segue to blackfire
  * Why backend is important
    * Drupal core is not exactly lightweight, contrib varies, custom + legacy code
    * We deal with many projects, working on slow ones makes me sad
  * Why blackfire
    * free*, easy to install
    * intuitive GUI and process (comparisions, collaboration)
    * does the job

--end--

## Case study: Coursecal

Site for students at McGill university to browse available courses.

* Search-driven UI, so caching can't help too much
* Tens of thousands of students hit the site at the same time
* So performance is critical!

Let's profile <a class="presenterlink" href="http://docker4:4569/faculties/engineering/undergraduate/ug_eng_dept_of_bioengineering">a page</a> with Blackfire!

<div class="notes">
  * Visit page
  * Make a profile
  * Tour the profile: READ NUMBERS
    * Metrics (overall, I/O, cpu, memory...)
      * Are these numbers ok for you?
    * Call graph
      * Hot path
      * Is this a reasonable amount of time for this function?
    * Function list
      * Calls, excl, incl
      * Expand: metrics (hover)
      * Expand: callees (time restricted to call)
      * Search
  * Let's find a problem function
    * Hot path: theme()
    * moriarty_preprocess_page is long for a preprocess hook!
    * Follow down graph until the time changes significantly
    * We get to loadAcademicFacultyNodes
    * Calling node_load 36 times! Could be multiple
</div>

--end--

<h2 class="mini">The slow code</h2>

    public function loadAcademicFacultyNodes($language = '', $key = 'name'){
      $return = array();
      foreach($this->faculties as $f){
        if ($f->nid && $f->code){
          if (!$language || $f->language === $language){
            $node = node_load($f->nid);
            if ($key && $f->$key){
              $return[$f->$key] = $node;
            } else {
              $return[] = $node;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      return $return;
    }

Iterate over some data, load nodes one at a time.

<div class="notes">
  * Loading nodes one at a time is slow! Should load them all together, to
    minimize the number of DB queries.
  * This code was written for D6, where node\_load\_multiple didn't exist
  * Now that it's in D7, let's fix it.
</div>

--end--

<h2 class="mini">A fix</h2>

    public function loadAcademicFacultyNodes($language = '', $key = 'name'){
      $nids = array();
      foreach($this->faculties as $f){
        if ($f->nid && $f->code){
          if (!$language || $f->language === $language){
            if ($key && $f->$key){
              $nids[$f->$key] = $f->nid;
            } else {
              $nids[] = $f->nid;
            }
          }
        }
      }

      $nodes = node_load_multiple($nids);
      $return = array();
      foreach ($nids as $k => $v) {
        $return[$k] = $nodes[$v];
      }
      return $return;
    }

Load them all at once

<div class="notes">
  * Grab all the node IDs
  * Load the nodes all at once
  * Return data in the expected structure
</div>

--end--

## Case study: Coursecal

TODO: show fixed results

A reasonable improvement in under an hour of work!

--end--

## Understanding Blackfire

* Blackfire.io
  * what it does, who it's by
  * advantages over xhprof
    * distribution (docker / chef / ansible), embedded (magento cloud, heroku)
    * SAAS nature
    * interactive callgraph, better user experience
    * don't display each node, just >1%
    * actively maintained... support for PHP 7
    * safer for production instrumentation
    * documentation, installation

--end--

## Installing blackfire

* Blackfire PHP C extension "probe", agent
* Companion (Chrome extension), command-line client
* Install steps on ubuntu

          wget -O - https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
          echo "deb http://packages.blackfire.io/debian any main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/blackfire.list
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install blackfire-agent blackfire-php
          # fill in server-id and server-token
          sudo blackfire-agent --register
          sudo /etc/init.d/blackfire-agent start

          # for command-line use, fill in client-id and client-token
          blackfire config

          # disable xhprof and xdebug php extensions
          # restart apache or php-fpm

* More info in [Blackfire Install Docs](https://blackfire.io/docs/24-days/06-installation)
  * includes instructions for OSX, Red hat, Windows, docker, chef, ...

--end--

## Blackfire features

* Comparison
* Copy as curl (ajax, cookies, POST requests)
* profiling command-line / drush commands
  * (drush.launcher)

--end--

## Case study: Client X

<img src="img/mystery.png" height="400" />

Complex siteâ€¦ that we can't show you

I wonder why they don't want you to know who they areâ€¦

<div class="notes">
  * Unfamiliar code base
  * Originally built by people unfamiliar with Drupal
</div>

--end--

## The problem

#### Homepage is slow

<span class="vspace"></div>

Let's check it out in Chrome inspector's _Network_ tab:

![](img/timeline.png)

<div class="notes">
  * There's a redirect to the English language landing page
  * The redirect is slow!
</div>

--end--

## Profiling

Our browser is at the path _/en_, so that's what Blackfire would profile

![](img/copy-curl.png)

<div class="notes">
  But we want to profile the redirect itself!
</div>

--end--

## Profiling

Give the results of _Copy as cURL_ to Blackfire:

![](img/curl-paste.png)

--end--

## Profiling

Give the results of _Copy as cURL_ to Blackfire:

![](img/pasted.png)

--end--

## Profiling

TODO

* command output
* profile
* analysis
* search for Drupal goto

--end--

## ðŸ˜±

    function tq_home_preprocess_page(&$variables) {
      $tq_init = array_key_exists('tq_lang_init', $_COOKIE) ? $_COOKIE['tq_lang_init'] : null;
      if ($tq_init === null) {
        setrawcookie('tq_lang_init', 1, REQUEST_TIME + 60*60*24*7, '/');
        $languages = language_list();
        $browser_lang = locale_language_from_browser($languages);
        if ($browser_lang !== $GLOBALS['language']->language && drupal_is_front_page()) {
          drupal_goto('<front>', array(
            'language' => $languages[$browser_lang],
          ));
        }
      }
    }

<p class="nonono">Don't do this!</p>

<div class="notes">
  What this code tries to do:
    * Homepage is in French only
    * The first time a user visits, redirect to their language's translation
    * Set a cookie to remember that they've been detected, so they can go to
      homepage to get French again.

  This code is what we call a "worst practice". Performance: It redirects the user AFTER rendering much of page, super slow.

  But also:
  * If user is detected as English, but then chooses Frenchâ€¦ one week later, redirected to English again!
  * If you have cookies blocked/disabled, you just redirect forever!
</div>

--end--

## A fix?

    function tq_home_init() {
      if (drupal_is_cli()) {
        return;
      }

      $tq_init = array_key_exists('tq_lang_init', $_COOKIE) ? $_COOKIE['tq_lang_init'] : null;
      // same as above
    }


Still not great, most of the problems from before remain.

--end--

## A fix?

But at least performance is better:

![](img/fixed.png)

--end--

## Case study: Client X

We improved performance, that's nice.

Also:

* We know more about the crazy things the site is doing
* Better understanding of future performance problems
  * Eg: Cookies and varnish
* We learned how to use _Copy as cURL_ with Blackfire!

--end--

## Advanced features

* aggregation (10 requests, averaged)
  * Turn aggregation to control for caching and side effects
* Blackfire doesn't keep arguments (or 1 at most)
* Sampling, not tracing!
* sharing profiles with your team, persistence
* use blackfire to learn new codebase (contrib)
* xdebug conflict + necessity
* Blackfire PHP SDK
* Tradeoff: memory vs time
* Caching and dirty runs
  * D7 + D8 cache killing

* diagnostic technques
  * references / comparison
  * xdebug
  * enableProbe / disableProbe
  * argument capturing

--end--

## Case study: D8 evolvingweb.ca

* Problem: Slow page
* Caching issues
  * Only when not in page_cache, dynamic_page_cache
  * This is a problem with aggregation!
  * Cache invalidation of just one node (CODE)
* Profile
  * Find slow function
* Diagnosis: block visibility
  * Loads all the blocks to check access
  * Complex condition checking, metadata merging
* Explain the fix
  * Like node access, one big query
  * Module: [block\_access\_records](https://github.com/vasi/block_access_records)
* Show comparison profile

--end--

## Pro Blackfire features

  * environments
    * groups of profiles and team members
    * one for dev / stage / prod, per project
  * data retention
  * CI + scenarios + notifications
    * trigger via web service
    * slack integration, etc.
  * assertions
  * custom metrics
  * recommendations

--end--

## Generic Drupal Backend Tips

* know these: varnish/memcache/APCu/Opcache
  * memcache only helps speed up cache_set/ cache_get and overall load on DB
* D8 render cache with tags + context
* D7 vs D8 (complexity Vs caching)
* Number of contrib modules
* Mysql tuning http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/web-design/2010/drupal-performance-white-paper
* Cron job, search, watchdog, SSD, multiple app heads, CDN, php7, fpm, nginx for files
* cookies + page cache
* devel web profiler
* entity_load_multiple()
